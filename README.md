# DiffALS-SuperResolution
This project, developed for the CE712 Digital Image Processing course at IIT Bombay, implements a state-of-the-art conditional diffusion framework for remote sensing super-resolution. The model incorporates a dedicated LR-conditioned noise predictor and a novel adversarial module to improve fine-detail and texture fidelity.
